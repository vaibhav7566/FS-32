In CSS there are two types of units which are-:

1).Absolute Units

The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as exactly that size.

Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout.

Unit	Description
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)
px *	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)
pt	points (1pt = 1/72 of 1in)
pc	picas (1pc = 12 pt)
* Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For printers and high resolution screens 1px implies multiple device pixels.


2).Relative units
Relative length units specify a length relative to another length property. Relative length units scale better between different rendering medium.

Unit	Description	
em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the  current font)	                                              Important to study
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)	
ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	           Important to study
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	       Important to study
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	       Important to study
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	
%	Relative to the parent element                         Important to study


viewport -> viewport bo part or area hota hai jispe aap aapki website ko draw karte ho,create karte or rander karte ho

vw -> viewport width
100vw = full viewport width

vh -> viewport height
100vh = full viewport height

vh & vw Relative rhti hai viewport ke


% -> ye unit apne parent element ke relative me kaam karti hain

rem -> depends on user's settings , html tag ke font size
       By default 1rem = 16px
em

Note -: font size ,padding ,margin,gap ke liye rem or em ka bhaut jyada use karte hai
